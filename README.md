# Welcome to **sudo-archies**! 🚀

### ✨ *A League of Extraordinary Developers!* ✨

We’re not a company, we’re not a startup… heck, we’re not even getting paid (yet). **sudo-archies** is a group of ambitious student developers on a mission to build cool stuff and, occasionally, break things (in the name of progress). From full-stack wizardry to AI sorcery and frontend heroics, we’ve got it all!
